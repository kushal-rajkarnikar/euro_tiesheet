# Euro 2016 Tiesheet
App that "will" show the time schedule for Euro 2016. Oh I mean it!

Tasks completed:
- Reading data from json file to display the matches according to date
- Sticky header dates 

Tasks remaining(in order of priority): 
- Figure out an appropriate place to display the group as well.
- Tapping on a match will reveal more details (venue, an image perhaps)
- Build an appropriate splash screena and logo.
- Convert the dates to GMT +05:45 Local Time. This going to be really tricky. Perhaps the conversion should occur before the loop?
- Push Notification x minutes before the match starts.
